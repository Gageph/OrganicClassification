# OrganicClassification
An AI trained with machine learning to detect whether food is organic or unorganic
This AI uses imagenet to detect if a food is organic or not based upon the packaging. It uses a Dataset and a resnet file both of which are linked on the other file. The way it works is after downloading the two files and putting them in their different directories. The Resnet file should go into the models folder in Jetson-inference/python/training/classification and the dataset should go into the data directory.
Additionally I have created a youtube video depicting how to use imagenet to run the AI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz8alSAirio
