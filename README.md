# OrganicClassification
An AI trained with machine learning to detect whether food is organic or unorganic
This AI uses imagenet to detect if a food is organic or not based upon the packaging. It uses a Dataset and a resnet file both of which are linked on the other file. It is required to download the two files and put them in different directories. The Resnet file should go into the models folder in Jetson-inference/python/training/classification and the dataset should go into the data directory under the same path. It works using imagenet, and the link to that repository is right here : https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/python/examples/imagenet.py
Additionally I have created a youtube video depicting how to use imagenet to run the AI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz8alSAirio
